# How to build a soccer team

To build a successful soccer team will require a lot of time, effort and patience. The *basic requirements* are 
* *players*, 
* *coaches*, 
* *soccer balls* 
* *field*  

## Players
The players will mostly be made up of people of around the same ***age*** range. 
an example of this is kids aged 12-15 could likely play together. 

## Coaches

Coaches should mostly be made up of individuals that has completed the coaching course prescribed by the united states. they *must* possess CPR license and they should be good teachers. The link for the coaching license can be found [here](https://learning.ussoccer.com)

## Field and Soccer Balls

Both of this could go hand in hand because it requires some expenses. The average cost of renting a field for a certain period of time could get expensive, which is why it is recommended to either have a good start up capital or have a sponsor for the team.
